        <h2>About Me</h2><br>
        <p>My name is Zeb Highmore, I am 20 years old, Bristol born n bred (South West does it best!) I love animals, films and music. I am studying coding at Codenation and hope to get an apprenticeship within the industry afterwards. I live with my girlfriend, Chloe, and my parents Ben and Wendy, plus my cat Pablo Escobar and the family dog Spider, see more about them on my animal page <a href="animals.html">here</a>.<br><br><p>~</p><br><p>I am passionate about coding and computers. I am highly self-motivated and a fast learner; prior to starting the course with Codenation I had been teaching myself Python using a book (How to think like a computer scientist) and have previously built my own PCs. I love a challenge; I find problem solving fun and rewarding. I am excellent at independent research, using the internet and trial and error to creatively find solutions. I am very ambitious about coding and its possibilities; being thoroughly interested in web development, front-end developing, back-end developing, full-stack developing, computers in general, and servers. I am excited to begin my career and start unlocking my full potential; I love exploring new things to do with coding, and am very enthusiastic, and committed, to learning more. I also have a lot of experience as a tech support agent for my friends and family.
