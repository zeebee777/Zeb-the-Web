        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Zeb Highmore, I am 20 years old, Bristol born n bred (South West does it best!) I love animals, films and music. I am studying coding at Codenation and hope to get an apprenticeship within the industry afterwards. I live with my girlfriend, Chloe, and my parents Ben and Wendy, plus my cat Pablo Escobar and the family dog Spider, see more about them on my animal page <a href="animals.html">here</a>.<br><br><p>~</p><br><p>I am a very fast learner especially when it comes to code. I love problem solving, I find it fun and rewarding. I thoroughly enjoy learning more about coding. I am self-motivated, I had been teaching myself python before I started with Codenation. I am very passionate about coding and cannot wait to begin my career and start unlocking more of my full potential.  I have excellent communication skills. I am very ambitious and passionate about coding, I am thoroughly interested in web development, front-end developing, back-end developing, computers in general, and servers. I am excellent at researching things for myself, using the internet and trial and error. I love exploring new things to do with coding, and am very enthusiastic about learning more. </p>
