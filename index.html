        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Zeb Highmore, I am 20 years old, Bristol born n bred (South West does it best!) I love animals, films and music. I am studying coding at Codenation and hope to get an apprenticeship within the industry afterwards. I live with my girlfriend, Chloe, and my parents Ben and Wendy, plus my cat Pablo Escobar and the family dog Spider, see more about them on my animal page <a href="animals.html">here</a>.<br><br><p>~</p><br><p>When it comes to films, I am fond of films like Shutter Island, The Usual Suspects, Inglorious Basterds, The Prestige, Fight Club, Goodfellas, Se7en, The Dark Knight trilogy, Django: Unchained, and Taxi Driver. I would say Scorsese is my favourite director, but I am a big fan of Tarantino and Christopher Nolan too.</p><br><br><p>~</p><br><p>With music my taste is very broad, but I mostly listen to hip-hop and indie music. I have been to a few music festivals such as Balter festival and Boomtown. I used to produce music but not really anymore. I also like to support local artists and listen to a lot of music that's from Bristolians.</p><br><br><p>~</p><br><p>And I love good food, and enjoy cooking. I was actually supposed to start an apprenticeship as a chef, but I broke my hand a week or two before the start date, and by the time I recovered lockdown had started and the restuarant decided against employing me. But I am quite glad, as this helped me realise I should pursue programming instead, as I am much better at it, it has better hours and better pay, and is less stressful.</p>
