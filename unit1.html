        <h2> > Outcome 1.1</h2>
        <p>IT plays a very important role in pretty much every industry these days. It can create more sales for retail shops, through online shopping and advertising. Software can help streamline complicated maths used in architecture and trades. IT can also be used to help to fine-tune your advertising, which helps you get more for your money from adverts due to it only being shown to your target audience, rather than anybody. IT can also help global businesses communicate across the globe. 
        </p>
        <h2> > Outcome 1.2</h2>
        <p>Some methods and skills that are vital to successfully complete projects are things like planning; it is important to plan out how you want your project to go, as this makes it a lot easier as you’re doing it, and helps you keep the bigger picture in mind. A resource you can use to help with planning your project is to use pseudo-code, you write out how you want the program to work, but just in English not with the syntax, this creates a good shell for your project which is a lot easier to read than code. Communication; if you’re completing this project with colleagues it is absolutely vital to have good communication,  to try and help cut down on the amount of time wasted, and to stream line the whole process. Research; it can be very helpful with your project to research. Even essential, unless you know everything you need to know to complete it. Some resources you can use to help you research include web forums such as Stack Overflow, or a book related to your chosen language. </p>
        <h2> > Outcome 1.3</h2>
        <p>A good place to start with a plan is to create an overview of what you want your project to achieve. For example, you might want to create a website which is user friendly and allows customers to add items to their cart and then check out and pay. A good next step would then be to write out your website in pseudo-code. This is a good idea as it helps you think about how your code can be set out efficiently, and how best to structure it, it also helps create a more readable version of your code, which even people who have no programming knowledge can understand, allowing people who wouldn’t otherwise be able to have any input, to offer suggestions. 
        </p>
        <h2> > Outcome 1.4</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">One potential risk of a digital project is that the platform you are writing for could update, causing the written code to become outdated and stop working, this becomes more likely as the project gets bigger. Another potential risk is that you could be working in a team and one or more of your associates could have another, more lucrative opportunity arise and abandon the project. Another risk is that your project may not be given the necessary resources, or it might have them to start and then the business might reallocate these resources to another task they deem to be a higher priority. Another risk is that you might create a much more user friendly design than the previous website or application, but due to being a different layout or having different features, some people may be resistant to the change and this could cause the business to lose customers.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 1.5</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">When selecting what IT systems and software to use it is important to know your objective, you need to know what you need to know what you want the software to do for you, to help you accurately select the right tool. If you are selecting software for a business to use it could be valuable to bring heads of departments onboard and put together a list of all the  requirements the company has for the software. It is also important to weigh up the functional requirements with the usability requirements, you might be able to find software that has all the required functionality, but the usability is so low that only the people in the IT department are comfortable to use it. On the other hand, there might be a software that is very usable, but only does half of the necessary things. It is crucial to find a balance. It is also important to think about longevity compared to budget and cost. There’s no point spending more than the company can afford to on a piece of software which is going to become obsolete within 2 years.  Once these have all been decided the most plausible next step would be to create a long list within a spread sheet. This list should include relevant software packages, though there is no point listing the pros/cons of these softwares as there is many comparison sites you can use for this. At this point, it’s easiest to rule out softwares that are unsuitable for whatever reason. Once you have narrowed the list down to the ones that tick all the fundamental criteria and are within budget, it is time to begin  testing  them with demos and trials.  A good way to effectively judge the different softwares whilst you trial them, is to create a requirements matrix.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 1.6</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Trello can help you achieve your outcomes, especially working on a project in a group as it allows everyone to be up to date with the tasks that others have completed or are working on. Git can be exceptionally useful due to it’s branching style version control. Branching allows you to create different independent branches of different versions of the same code. This allows you to easily try new ideas without worrying about messing with the original code, and git allows you to go back to earlier versions, delete, merge, or recall different branches very easily. Another perk of Git is it is local, once downloaded it doesn’t need internet connection, also, it is free and easy to use. GitHub is an online database for sharing and keeping track of Git projects. It is cloud based so requires an internet connection. GitHub is amazing for group projects, once you share your code with others it allows them to make edits on your Git branches, letting a whole team work on the same project in real-time, from anywhere in the world, and when they make changes new branches are created so that they don’t overwrite your work. 
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 1.7</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Legal guidelines that impact digital projects involve the right to access - any individual has the right to request access to all their personal data held by the company, and to ask how their data is being used by the company. The company must facilitate the individuals request, free of charge, or risk being taken to court over breaching GDPR. Individuals also hold the  right to be forgotten, if consumers are no longer customers or if they revoke their consent from the company, then they have the right to have their data deleted. Individuals also have the right to data portability -  this means, upon request, the company must transfer their data to another service provider, and it must be sent in a commonly used and machine readable format.</p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 2.1</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">I was very happy with the IT tools I used when making my own website, especially VS Code, I think VS code is a very good code editor, which is incredibly easy to use and nice to look out. The colour coding and the predictive text features are very helpful especially. I also like the way it keeps tabs open of the files you’re editing, and keeps all files within the folder on the left side. This is very good because it allows you to have a big folder, full of images you need, and it doesn’t get cluttered changing between different HTML pages and the CSS page, but also makes it easy to remember what the image you’re trying to reference is called, as you can see it on the left. Trello was also helpful as it helps encourage me to think of more ideas, and also creates a place where it’s easy to see all of your ideas, and what’s been done or not. One thing I do think I would’ve liked to use is LivePreview, which automatically updates your site as you edit, without the need to save and refresh. However, I don’t have a second monitor, just my laptop screen, so I  don’t think this would’ve been especially helpful for me, but if I had 2 screens I would’ve definitely used it.
</p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 2.2</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">The IT tools selected were absolutely appropriate. VS Code especially. Trello wouldn’t have necessarily  been appropriate if it wasn’t for me submitting it after, as I am not working on this project in a team, and prefer pen to paper planning when working on my own, however, if this was a bigger project with several people working on it then Trello would be nearly essential. VS code was very appropriate as it made things easier for me, allowing me to complete tasks quicker.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 2.3</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">I am happy with my final project overall. I am happy with how it looks, and how smooth and easy it was to create. One thing I’m not pleased with is the amount  of content on the website, I do wish I had more pages, however, I don’t especially like talking about myself, and don’t want to fill the  site with random irrelevant stuff just for  the sake of it. I am happy with the simplistic style of the site. I have some prior experience with HTML, but none with CSS, so I had previously thought that making a website look good was really really hard. I was pleasantly surprised once we started learning CSS.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 2.4</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Some further improvements that could be made to my site would be for the site to include more content, and more complex CSS. I would like to add more variation through the site as well, but this feels pointless with such a small website, I feel this would be much more successful with a larger website. 
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 2.5</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">My outcome is  fit for  purpose. It also matches the  requirements, I believe. Overall, I am very pleased with my website, and I thought it would be more difficult to make it look good.  I got my girlfriend and my mum to have a look at it and give feedback, they both gave positive feedback but my mum  said it’s a bit sparse and could do with more content.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 3.1</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Some drawbacks of the IT tools I used include, creating a Trello board, though this was helpful for helping me come up with more ideas, it reduced my productivity as it wasn’t really needed for a solo project so it wasted time making one. Also, a drawback is  that  whenever you open a tag in HTML it automatically closes right  after, this can be helpful on a new project but, as I did not know anything about CSS when we did the HTML bit, I had to add a lot of divs to content that was already there, so having it automatically close immediately after I open it was slightly annoying. Some benefits to productivity from the IT tools I used include the tabs on VS code, as well as the file list on the left, this allowed me to easily switch between my HTML files and CSS file, whilst also being able to see the names of image files I was calling on, using the file list on the left. Also, the predictive text feature increased my productivity as it allowed me to just hit tab after typing just a few letters. This seems like a minuscule amount of time saved, but it really adds up.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 3.2</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Some ways productivity could be increased  would be to complete the project in a team and use Slack and Trello to stay up to date, and a video call software like Zoom to discuss project ideas. Another way to improve efficiency would be to use a second screen and Live Preview so I could save time saving the file, tabbing into chrome and refreshing the site. Also, if I had a mouse with extra buttons, I would like to set these extra buttons to switch between tabs in VS code. 
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 3.3</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Some solutions I would develop to improve productivity would be to set up a team for the project, and use Slack to contact each other and share code, and Trello to keep people up to date on what needs to be done, is being done, and has been done. Another solution would be to set up shortcuts and macros relating to VS Code that allow for even quicker navigation. I would also change  the colour scheme for VS Code, although it is still very helpful as it is, I feel if I customised it it would  work even better for me.
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 3.4</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">I would test these solutions very simply. I would simply bind the shortcut to a mouse button and then open VS Code and press the button that had been bound, and see if it works as intended. I would test the colour scheme simply by using it, and updating parts of it that I don’t think are helping. It would be hard to test the team solution, as it’s either as part of a team or not, and I would feel bad saying to someone that I want them to leave the team. </p>
        <br><div class="centre"><h1 data-aos="fade-down">UNIT 2</h1></div>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 1.1</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">I wanted to have a similar layout and style throughtout the different pages, to create a uniform website where you know exactly what website you’re on due to distinct simplicity and lots of similarities. I have 4 pages on my website, the homepage (index), which is just a title and sub-title followed by paragraphs. The coursework page, which is just all of my written work, divided with with subheadings, and with 2 main titles to announce the beginning of each unit. I also have an animals page which features a title, then several subheadings, each subheading is followed with a short sentence and then some pictures. The last page is the most simple, it is just a title, a short sentence with a link to my trello board, and a screenshot of my trello in case the link breaks. Every page features 4 buttons on the top, of which 3 of link to other pages on the website, and one to a YouTube video. On every page also there is a logo which stays in the top left no matter where the user is on the website. This logo leads to the homepage. Both the logo and the buttons reduce in opacity when you hover the mouse over them.

        <p>Copyright is a law regarding to intellectual property. Intellectual property means that people have ownership over the things they create,  like how something psychical can be owned. Copyright infringement happens when a person doesn’t  have permission from the creator but they still show the copywriter thing to the public or copy it. This can affect images you might want to use for your website, if it’s copyrighted you need the permission of the  individual or company that owns the image to be able to put it on your website. If you take your website live and have copyrighted images that you don’t have permission to use, this is copyright infringement and you could get sued. Also, you would need to have permission from the author if you wanted to include a section from a copyrighted book on your website. 
        </p>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left"> > Outcome 1.6</h2>
        <p>One access issue that needs to be taken into account when creating a website is bad vision, many people don’t  have the best eye sight and can find it hard to read text if it’s a similar colour to whatever is behind it. It is important to remember this when choosing colours, and make sure it’s not similar. Another access issue could be browser type, if your website works on Chrome but not on IE/Safari/Firefox you are cutting  out a lot of potential visitors. It is vital to make sure your site works as intended on all browsers. It is also important to add the alternative text to  images, so if a blind person visits your site using a text to speech add on, they will hear what the pictures are that they can’t see.
